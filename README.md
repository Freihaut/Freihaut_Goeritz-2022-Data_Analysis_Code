### General Information

This repository contains the data and data analysis code, which was used in the longitudinal field study data about
the relationship between computer keyboard typing behavior and emotional states. The corresponding research paper is currently submitted and has not been published yet.

The data was analyzed with Python (3.8.12)


### Repository Structure

The repository contains 2 data files, 3 data analysis code files and 2 results files

1. The **Data Files** are the raw-data file as well as the processed keyboard-features file (the output of the raw-data preprocessing that is used for the data anlysis)
2. The **Data Analysis Code Files** are the raw-data preprocessing code (to create the processed keyboard-feature data file), code to get some descriptive statistics and the machine learning data analysis code
3. The **Result Files** are the results of the generalized emotional state prediction scenario and the individualized emotional state prediction scenario


Using the files in this repository it should be possible to replicate all data analysis results reported in the corresponding research paper.
